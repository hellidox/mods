# mods
mods for funny server, `git clone https://github.com/hellidox/mods.git` to download with git, if you use normal launcher `git clone https://github.com/hellidox/mods.git %appdata%\.minecraft\mods\` should work

you'll have to go download [minecolonies](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minecolonies/download/2932783) yourself

UNLESS EXPLICITLY STATED I DO NOT OWN THE RIGHTS TO ANY OF THESE MODS. IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO TAKE ONE DOWN, PLEASE OPEN A PULL REQUEST.
